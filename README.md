# Omni 2D

An HTML/JS/Canvas app wrapped by [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) into
a real, installable Android APK.

- **Part 0** proved the build pipeline end to end: a blank canvas, wrapped
  by Capacitor, built into an installable APK.
- **Part 1** (current) adds the app shell's screens, navigation, and
  visual theme — Home, Animate mode, and Recording, plus the export modal
  — all with placeholder behavior (console logs, no real file output yet).
  **There is still no bone/mesh/skeleton/animation logic** — that's a
  later step. See "App states & how to navigate" below for how to test
  the flow on your phone.

## What's in this repo

```
www/index.html          App shell markup (screens, buttons, export modal)
www/css/style.css       The black/pink theme, layout, and button states
www/js/state.js         The app's state machine (home/animating/recording) — no DOM code
www/js/canvas.js        Rendering-engine facade — currently just clears the canvas;
                         future bone/mesh/animation code hooks in here
www/js/ui.js             DOM wiring: button handlers, disabled states, the export modal
www/js/app.js            Thin entry point that boots ui.js once the page loads
capacitor.config.json   Tells Capacitor the app's name, ID, and where the web files live
android/                The native Android project Capacitor generated (this is what Gradle builds)
package.json            Node project file listing Capacitor as a dependency
```

You will **not** need to hand-edit anything inside `android/` — Capacitor
manages it for you.

## Easiest option: download a pre-built APK, no local setup at all

This repo has a GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`) that automatically builds the debug
APK in the cloud every time code is pushed to `main` or a `claude/**`
branch. You don't need Node, Android Studio, or anything else installed to
get an installable APK this way — just a browser and your phone.

There are two ways to grab it from GitHub:

1. **Releases page (recommended — stable link).** Go to the repo's
   **Releases** page (right-hand sidebar on GitHub, or
   `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases`) and open **"Latest Debug
   APK."** Download `app-debug.apk` from the Assets list. This release is
   overwritten on every push, so the link never changes — bookmark it and
   it'll always have the newest build.
2. **Actions artifacts (tied to one specific build).** Go to the
   **Actions** tab, click the most recent **Build Android APK** run, and
   download the `omni2d-debug-apk` artifact from the "Artifacts" section
   at the bottom of the run page. Artifacts expire after 30 days and
   require being logged into GitHub to download; the Release above doesn't.

Either way, once the `.apk` file is on your phone, open it with a file
manager and tap **Install** (Android will ask permission to "install
unknown apps" the first time — allow it for that app/source). No cable,
no `adb`, no Android Studio required.

If you want to trigger a fresh build without pushing a new commit, go to
**Actions → Build Android APK → Run workflow**.

> **One-time repo setting, if the release step fails with a permissions
> error:** GitHub sometimes defaults a repo's Actions token to read-only.
> If the workflow fails specifically on the "Publish/update latest debug
> build release" step, go to **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow
> permissions**, select **"Read and write permissions,"** save, then
> re-run the workflow.

The rest of this README covers building the APK yourself locally — useful
once you're actively editing code and want faster iteration than waiting
on a cloud build each time.

## Prerequisites (one-time setup on your machine)

Do these once, before you touch the terminal steps below.

1. **Node.js version 22 or newer.**
   Capacitor's CLI requires Node ≥ 22. Check what you have with:
   ```
   node -v
   ```
   If it's older than 22, download the current LTS installer from
   [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and install it.

2. **Android Studio** (this gives you the Android SDK, an emulator, and a
   JDK all in one installer — you generally do *not* need to install Java
   separately).
   Download it from
   [developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and
   run the installer. On first launch it opens a "Setup Wizard" — accept the
   defaults; this downloads the Android SDK (the tools/libraries needed to
   compile an Android app) and a bundled JDK (the Java compiler Gradle uses
   under the hood, currently JDK 17+, which Android Studio installs for
   you).

3. **A phone with USB debugging enabled** (only needed if you want to
   install over USB rather than copying the APK file manually):
   - On your phone, go to **Settings → About phone** and tap **Build
     number** 7 times. This unlocks a hidden **Developer options** menu.
   - Go to **Settings → System → Developer options** and turn on **USB
     debugging**.
   - Plug the phone into your computer with a USB cable. When prompted on
     the phone, tap **Allow** to trust the computer.

That's it for one-time setup. Everything below is repeatable.

## Steps to build and install the APK

Run these from the root of this repository (the folder containing
`package.json`).

### (a) Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

**What this does:** downloads Capacitor's command-line tool and libraries
into a `node_modules/` folder. This only touches the JavaScript side of
things — it does not build anything Android-related yet.

### (b) Build the web assets

There is nothing to build yet. `www/index.html` is plain HTML/JS with no
bundler (no Webpack/Vite/etc.) — it *is* the finished web output already.
Once real app code is added in a later step, this is where a `npm run
build` command would compile it into `www/`. For now, skip straight to
step (c).

### (c) Sync the web assets into the Android project

```
npx cap sync android
```

**What this does:** copies everything in `www/` into the native Android
project under `android/app/src/main/assets/public`, and makes sure the
Android project's configuration matches `capacitor.config.json` (app name,
app ID, plugins, etc.). Run this command any time you change a file inside
`www/` and want that change reflected in the Android build. It does **not**
produce an APK by itself — it just prepares the native project.

### (d) Produce a debug APK

You have two options: using Android Studio's UI (easier for a first time),
or the command line (faster once you're comfortable).

#### Option 1 — Android Studio (recommended for your first build)

1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Choose **Open** and select the `android/` folder inside this repo (not
   the repo root — the `android` subfolder specifically).
3. Wait for the bottom status bar to finish "Gradle sync" (this is Android
   Studio downloading the specific tool versions this project needs and
   indexing the project — it can take several minutes the first time and
   needs an internet connection).
4. Once sync finishes with no red errors, go to the menu **Build → Build
   Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**.
5. When it finishes, a small popup appears in the bottom-right corner
   saying "APK(s) generated successfully" with a **locate** link — click it
   to open the folder containing the file. It will be at:
   ```
   android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

#### Option 2 — Command line (`gradlew`)

From the `android/` folder:

```
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

(On Windows, use `gradlew.bat assembleDebug` instead.)

**What this does:** `gradlew` is the "Gradle wrapper" — a script bundled
with the project that downloads the exact version of Gradle (Android's
build tool) this project needs, then runs it. `assembleDebug` tells Gradle
to compile the Android project into an unsigned, debug-mode APK — debug
APKs are automatically signed with a throwaway debug key so they can be
installed for testing without you needing to create your own signing key
yet.

When it finishes, the APK is at the same path as above:
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### (e) Install the APK on your phone

Pick whichever is easier for you:

**Via USB (using `adb`, which ships with the Android SDK):**

```
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

If `adb` isn't recognized in your terminal, it lives inside the Android SDK
folder Android Studio installed, typically under
`platform-tools/adb` (e.g. `~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb` on
macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe` on Windows). You
can also run it directly from Android Studio: **Run → Run 'app'** with your
phone selected as the target device does the build-and-install in one step.

**Via file transfer (no cable/adb needed):**

1. Copy `app-debug.apk` to your phone (email it to yourself, use a cloud
   drive, USB file transfer, etc.).
2. On your phone, open the file using a file manager app.
3. Android will ask for permission to "install unknown apps" the first
   time — allow it for that one app/source.
4. Tap **Install**.

Once installed, you should see an app named **Omni 2D** in your app
drawer. Opening it should show the black-and-pink app shell described
below — that confirms the entire pipeline works end to end.

## App states & how to navigate (manual test flow)

This build has no bone/mesh/animation logic yet — every button below is a
placeholder that just logs to the console (visible via `adb logcat` or
Android Studio's Logcat panel if you want to watch them) or shows a modal.
What you're testing here is purely the screen flow and button
enabled/disabled behavior.

There are three app states:

1. **Home** — the starting screen. Shows the (currently blank) canvas
   with an **Import** button top-left and a large **Animate** button
   across the bottom.
   - Tapping **Import** just logs `Import triggered` — no file picker yet.
   - Tapping **Animate** moves you into Animate mode →
2. **Animating** — Animate mode, before recording starts. The canvas gets
   a pink border, and an "ANIMATE MODE" label appears top-right. Controls
   change to an **✕** (exit), **Start**, and a greyed-out, disabled
   **Stop**.
   - Tapping **✕** exits back to **Home**.
   - Tapping **Start** begins "recording" →
3. **Recording** — after Start is pressed. The canvas border and mode
   label turn red, the label reads "RECORDING...", **Start** becomes
   disabled/greyed, and **Stop** becomes the active button.
   - Tapping **✕** here cancels the recording (logs a message) and exits
     straight back to **Home**.
   - Tapping **Stop** ends the recording, returns you to the
     **Animating** state, and automatically opens the **Export modal**.

**Export modal** (appears automatically after Stop, not its own button):
a filename field (defaults to `animation_01` if left blank), **Save as
GIF** / **Save as MP4** buttons (both just log a placeholder export
message — no real encoding yet), and a red **Cancel** button that closes
the modal without exporting. Closing the modal either way leaves you in
the **Animating** state, ready to Start another recording.

A quick end-to-end pass to try on your phone: **Home → Animate → Start →
Stop → (export modal appears) → Save as GIF → back in Animate mode →
✕ → Home**. Also worth checking: tapping **✕** while **Recording** should
cancel straight back to Home, and disabled buttons (**Stop** on the
Animating screen, **Start** on the Recording screen) should be visibly
greyed out and not respond to taps.

## What's next

Once you've confirmed this screen flow works on your phone, the next
step layers in the real rendering/animation engine (bones, mesh,
skeleton, drag handling) behind this same shell. That logic is designed
to hook into `www/js/canvas.js`, which is kept deliberately separate from
the state/UI code in `www/js/state.js` and `www/js/ui.js` — look for the
`FUTURE HOOK` comments in those files.
